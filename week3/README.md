# MSSE663-js-exercices

Javascript exercises for the MSSE 663 Web Frameworks course. The exercises are split by branch for the week, and each one will build on your ability to develop a full-stack application.

## Code Exercises

As part of the web frameworks course, students are required to submit exercises weekly that strengthen their understanding of OOP concepts using javascript and/or typescript.

Exercises should be complete by

1. Creating your own Github account, if you haven't done so already.
2. Forking this repo to your own Github account.
3. Cloning the repo to your machine for local development.
4. Making commits and pushes against you own version of this repo.

## Completing Assignments

Before you being doing any work, first make sure that you're setup and ready for the begin.

1. Make sure you're on the correct branch:

```bash
$ git checkout week1
```

2. If you're continuing work from a previous submission, make a new branch from the last submitted branch. ex.:

```bash
$ git checkout week1
$ git checkout -b week2
```

3. Then follow the instructions for the week's assignment in [INSTRUCTIONS.md]().

## Submitting Assignments

Each assignment should be completed in its week's branch with the following steps.

1. Make sure you're own the correct branch:

```bash
$ git checkout week1
```

2. Get all files ready for commit to your repo:

```bash
$ git commit -m "type commit message here"
```

3. Store your changes to the repo with:

```bash
$ git push <branch_name>
```

Where `<branch_name>` is the name of the branch you're currently on. 4. Int Github, select the branch and copy the link to it. Then paste it in WorldClass under the appropriate week.
