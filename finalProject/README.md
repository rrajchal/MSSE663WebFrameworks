# Computer Solution Technology Service

## Description
I have developed a web application for a Computer Solution Technology service that offers comprehensive support for both hardware and software needs. The software architecture is a mix between MVC (Model-View-Controller) and client-server design patterns, ensuring efficient data management and a seamless user experience.

### Key Features:
1. **Hardware Support**:
   - An inventory system displaying available products directly in the browser.
2. **Software and Technical Support**:
   - A detailed list of services and their respective prices.
3. **User Experience**:
   - Users can view product details, add products to the cart, and purchase items.
   - The payment process is streamlined with proper credit card handling, using an API or a third-party credit card validation system.
   - Upon purchase, users receive confirmation via email, text, or message.
4. **Admin Features**:
   - Admin users can manage products, including creating, viewing, updating, and deleting products.
