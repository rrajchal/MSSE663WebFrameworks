## Progress
09/20/2024: Added backend - Data is displayed from backend

## Description
I plan to develop a web application for a Computer Solution Technology service. This website will offer comprehensive support for both hardware and software needs. The software architecture will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, where the user will interact with the controller, and the controller will connect to the database.
Key Features:
1.	Hardware Support:
    - An inventory system displaying available products directly in the browser.
2.	Software and Technical Support:
    - A detailed list of services and their respective prices.
3.	User Experience:
    - Users will be able to purchase hardware and software through the website.
    - The payment process will be streamlined with proper credit card handling. I am planning to use an API or a third-party credit card validation system. 
    - Upon purchase, users will receive confirmation via email, text, or message.
